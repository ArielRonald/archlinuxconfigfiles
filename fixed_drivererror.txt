So I run the next command:
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe kitty
and then kitty finally opens. The problem is that when I close the window I need to rerun the same command to be able to open it again.
I have set the environmental variables in /etc/environment:

LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true

GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe


But nothing changes. I don't know hot to stabilise those values so every time I boot I can launch kitty.
I also tried
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true
and it works but when I reboot I'm facing the same issue again.
I don't know what else I can do. Maybe I'm setting wrong the environmental variables.
